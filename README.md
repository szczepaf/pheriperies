This data science project will focus on pheriperies in Czechia. 
In the first step, we will create a dataset describing how close are Czech cities to large, regional cities. We will look only at train connections and create the dataset by querying the IDOS website.
In the second step, we will look at whether it is correlated that a city is pheripheral (meaning distant via train connections) from regional centers and whether the voters in that city prefer anti-democratic parties in parliamentary elections. We will use one of the official election datasets to try to find the connections.

The data processing will be done in Python. The output will be a data science report.
